UNSW codeRs is a student and staff run community dedicated for 'R' users. We set up events that cater to learning R. We meet fortnightly, alternating between workshops, drop-in help sessions, and other social events.

We meet every 1st and 3rd Mondays of the month during the academic terms. You can find us in Mathews room 105 between 2.30-3.30. Everyone is welcome to join.

You can go [here](https://unsw-coders.netlify.app/workshops/) to find out more information about upcoming workshops and check out the flyer below for more information about the drop-in help sessions.
