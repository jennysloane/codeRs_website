UNSW codeRs is a student and staff run community dedicated for 'R' users. We set up events that cater to learning R. We meet fortnightly, alternating between workshops, drop-in help sessions, and other social events. <br><br>

We meet every **1st and 3rd Mondays of the month** during the academic terms. You can find us in **Mathews room 105 between 2.30-3.30**. Everyone is welcome to join!<br><br>

## **Workshops**

- We have great workshops lined up for this year, including workshops on purrr, making websites with blogdown, and creating beautiful visualisations with ggplot!
- Check out the [workshop page](https://unsw-coders.netlify.app/workshops/) to find out more information about upcoming workshops 

## **Drop-in Help Sessions** 

- It doesn't matter if you are a complete beginner to R or if you have years of experience, everyone is welcome and encouraged to stop by our drop-in sessions
- This is the perfect space to bring all of your coding questions or even just to hang out and code along side other R users, so feel free to stop by even if you don't have any specific questions
