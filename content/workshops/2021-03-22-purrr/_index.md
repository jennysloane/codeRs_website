**Abstract:**
Scientific research is often a "broken record" game: we must repeat the same calculations over and over again. In this inaugural USNW codeRs workshop, Aniko will teach you how to repeat yourself efficiently in R without using copy-paste. We will take a look at loops, covering the basic building blocks and syntax needed to iterate over data. Then we will discuss the limitations of loops, and introduce functional programming as an alternative. She will go on to show you how you can create easily readable code, eliminate clunky loops, and streamline your workflow with the powerful and elegant purrr package, a core package in the tidyverse. This workshop will be targeted at people with minimal programming experience, but seasoned users will benefit as well. Come with the latest version of R loaded on your laptop, or come a few minutes early so we can help you load it!

**Bio:** 
Anikó completed her PhD at Macquarie University in 2019. Originally from the US, she was a research consultant at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History prior to moving here. She is a member of the Evolution of Terrestrial Ecosystems program, which researches community assembly processes of land animals and plants on geological timescales. She is currently a postdoc working with David Keith on risk assessment models for Antarctic ecosystems. Aniko is passionate about helping researchers improve their digital literacy and coding skills. She is a trained Software Carpentry instructor and led the R users group at Macquarie University for two years before coming to UNSW.
