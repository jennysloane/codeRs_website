<strong>Abstract:</strong>
"Random Forests" are used everywhere, and for good reason! Random Forest is a powerful and versatile machine learning algorithm that grows and combines multiple decision trees to create a "forest". It sounds very complex, but learning to use them is very intuitive, especially if you have a **USNW codeRs workshop** to help you.

## Resources created by JR

Download or clone the workshop material from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UNSW-codeRs/workshop-random-forests). This repository contain all the material discussed in the workshop and will help you follow the recording. This includes a short presentation on using decision trees to describe rules for classifying data, and how multiple, randomized trees can get us to more accurate classifications. Then two R-markdown document are available to guide you through the code needed to fit classification trees and Random Forests using popular R packages.
